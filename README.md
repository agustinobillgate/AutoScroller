# DESCRIPTION
This is an Automatic Scroller App. 
The idea of making this app is because I'm so lazy to scroll my phone when reading a long text like when reading Light Novel on Chrome.
I want to make a handsfree experience while reading or checking some images, which is why I decided to make this and hoping it can help others too.
The apps will run on background and allows it to run on top of other apps, user need to enable Accessibility service for this.
It allows user to select the scroll behavior, whether it's Top to Bottom, Bottom to Top, Left to Right or Right Left.
User can also adjust the duration between each scroll and the range of the scrolls by pixels.

- Adjustable Scrolls Behavior (Top to Bottom, Bottom to Top, Left to Right, Right to Left)
